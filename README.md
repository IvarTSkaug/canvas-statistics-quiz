#Python script that uses text2qti to generate a statistics quiz for Canvas.
The quiz contains multiple variations of the same questions. Values and variable names are randomized.
Running the script "main.py" will generate a text file "quiz.txt". This file can be converted using text2qti into a .zip file which can be imported directly into Canvas.
